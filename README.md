# VLSI

Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI): optimizing the layout of rectangular circuits on a fixed-width plate to minimize the overall device length.

We approach this problem using three distinct methodologies: Constraint Programming (CP), propositional SATisfiability (SAT) and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). To accomplish this, we leverage the MiniZinc CP solver and the Z3 SAT/SMT solver.
